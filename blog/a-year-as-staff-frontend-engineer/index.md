A year has passed since I joined [Flink](https://www.goflink.com/) as a Staff Frontend Engineer.  
Now is time to look back and reflect.  
  
## Intro

When I was joining [Flink](https://www.goflink.com/), a [multi-billions](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/flink-the-berlin-based-instant-grocery-startup-is-now-valued-at-2-85b-after-raising-750m-in-a-round-led-by-doordash/) valuated grocery delivery startup, I had no idea what the role is about. I bought a [book](https://staffeng.com/book) which gave some insights about the responsibilities of Staff engineers, but the scope seemed too vague, and it wasn't clear how it would look in practice in my particular case and whether that position was for me.  
  
The change was intimidating and intriguing at the same time.
  
Now, having worked for a year at that position, I can certainly say that it was one of the best decisions I made in life, and it was probably the most fruitful year of my career.  
  
During the year, I constantly dragged myself into new areas of work, and I learned and achieved a lot. I built confidence in aspects of work that I always thought were not for me and not in my comfort zone. I realized that there are many other things besides coding that I like and am very efficient at. My appetite grew a lot from one achievement to another.

## Learnings

### Build relationships and earn credibility

Right from the beginning, I worked on building relationships with my colleagues, especially frontend engineers, and earning their trust.  
  
I felt I needed to prove first that I can write code, that I care about quality, that I can provide thoughtful PR reviews, that I can help find bugs and fix them, that I have a broad knowledge of the frontend landscape, that I know what I'm doing, and that people can rely on me.

Regular one-on-ones with developers also helped a lot in building relationships. It gave me the opportunity to learn about their struggles, their perspectives on things, and get their feedback on how I performed and how I could help them.

That helped me a lot going forward in implementing my initiatives and getting buy-in from developers.
  
### Don't be a bottleneck

With a good, strong reputation, it's easy to become a bottleneck when people start approaching you directly looking for help. That way, other developers miss an opportunity to help and to learn, and you have to spend more time answering all kinds of questions.

Knowledge sharing is important, and whenever anyone needs help, other colleagues should have the opportunity to be helpful and learn from others' mistakes.

I created a dedicated channel for frontend engineers in slack and was constantly redirecting questions to that channel and promoting this channel.
  
### Knowledge sharing and building a community

Often, organizational structure doesn't promote cross-team or cross-department collaboration. Developers work on their projects in isolation which negatively affects their company because the same solutions are constantly being re-implemented and the same issues occur across different projects. Lack of collaboration also means fewer opportunities to learn and grow, which leads to dissatisfaction and a poor retention rate.

I realized that it's very important to build a strong frontend community where developers can be excited about their work, share knowledge, help each other, and have common things to work on.

My approach was to set up regular frontend meetups and push developers to present their topics there - to share what issues they have fixed and things they are excited about. I myself regularly shared important information about the company's web landscape, hosting solutions, caching issues, etc.

Also, I was looking for opportunities to create common ground for all projects - creating utilities and libraries used by all projects across the company. That gives developers an opportunity to create an impact on the whole organization and creates a space for collaboration with other developers.

### Focus on impact and your expertize

Whenever you are new to the company, it can be challenging to understand where to start and what to work on. The same challenge might come up even for company veterans. I was there as well.

I had moments where I wanted to join some backend focused initiatives just because they were interesting to me, and I didn't see interesting and impactful enough areas in frontend engineering. It was a trap, and I'm glad that I avoided it.

What helped me in such moments of doubt was reminding myself that I'm the most !!!knowledgeable!!! frontend engineer in the company and that there definitely should be something for me in my area of expertise and interests. With that in mind, I explored what was happening in other domains (departments) and their struggles and issues, and, as a result, I moved to another department that needed my help. At the same time, I challenged the status quo in my old department and came up with an initiative to create a web platform team and become a product manager for that team.

### Care about who is your manager

The work you do as a Staff Engineer might not be directly visible to the rest of the company. There can be no direct relationship between your work and the company's performance.

For example, how can you quantify the impact you are creating by building a frontend community, setting up a proper interview process, and hiring best-in-class developers?

Also, if your manager is responsible for a particular domain and your work exceeds by far the scope of that domain, it can be hard for your manager to see the real value of your work for a company.

As I realized, that can become a real problem for my future growth and career. The lesson I learned here is to be conscious of who is your manager and make sure they are interested in the work you do and that your reporting line makes sense at all.

## What I like about my work

### Freedom

The position gives me freedom - I am in charge of deciding what to work on. I don't have to work on boring and trivial tasks, like building ui forms, anymore. Instead, I focus on challenging, impactful, and full of learnings tasks where I can fully express my expertise and experience.

Nobody expects me to write code myself and deliver something every day. That gives me time and peace of mind for deep thinking and evaluation of different ideas, to be creative, and to also invest time in people, work more with them, which I have started to like.

A dream job, isn't it?

### Power

I am a member of my domain leadership group and my voice is respected. I can influence teams' roadmaps, I can influence the trajectory of web development at the domain level and even at the company level, and I can come up with initiatives for teams to work on.

Freedom and Power combined make me extremely happy and enable me to be as impactful as I can.

## Things I wish I had more time for

### Writing code

With Freedom and Power in my hands, writing code myself would restrict my impact and, as a result, my value for a company. It doesn't scale. To be more impactful, I need to focus on things that scale, for example, leveling up other developers.

As a result, I have to write less code myself, and that is one of the things I don't like about the position of Staff engineer. You should be an expert in your area, but you have less time for hands-on experience. You should find the right balance here.

## Conclusion

Changing my position from Senior to Staff Frontend engineer was a tremendous shift for me.

It has been a very fruitful, exciting, and full of learnings experience.

It allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills at scale.
